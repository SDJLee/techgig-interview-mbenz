// computeRoute computes the slice of minimum number of stations to be visited to recharge before reaching the destinatio.
// The logic follows a greedy approach where we charge the car only at stations that can provide maximum number of charges when compared to all other stations at that state.
// Below is the logical explanation of the method.
// 1. We find out the maximum distance the car can travel with available charge.
// 2. If the destination can be reached with available charge, we return an empty slice. It means that there is no need for the car to stop for recharging since the available charge is sufficient.
// 3. If the destination cannot be reached with available charge, the logic simulates the car to travel to maximum distance possible noting down the stations along the route in priority queue.
// The priority queue will be in descending order respect to the charge available in station. For example, if the station and charge pair are S1:10, S2:20, S3:30, then the priority queue will return
// in the order S3:30, S2:20, S1:10. We always pick the next station that provides maximum charge.
// 4. If the charge in a station is not sufficient, we pick the next station from the priority queue. This is done till either the queue is empty or the charge becomes sufficient.
// 5. The station names where the car recharges are added to the returning slice.
// The method returns a slice containing names of the stations where the car is recharged. The slice is empty if no station is visited. This is when the charge is sufficient to reach destination.
// The method also returns a error variable. This error is to denote that the car will not make it to the destination as there is no sufficient charge.
// The time complexity of this logic is O(nlog(n)). We iterate n times and greedily check if recharge is required.
